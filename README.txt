This is the final milestone submission for our app development. 
In this milestone, we have successfully implemented following functionalities in our app:

1. Provided university and category specific topic access to the students.
2. Implemented the search functionality.

Presently, we have listed 3 states namely New York, California and Alabama and 2 universities per state.
We also have provided the basic search functionality in which the topics will be listed depending upon university, category and search topic name.

There are opportunities to improve this app. The future work along with the user documentation on how to use this app effieciently is provided in 
Milestone 5 User Documentation pdf file.
